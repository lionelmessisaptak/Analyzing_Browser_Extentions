## Objective  
To inspect and evaluate browser extensions for potential security or privacy risks, and remove any that may negatively impact user safety or system performance.

## Tools Used  
- Google Chrome  
- Mozilla Firefox  

---

## Steps Followed  

### 1. Opened Extension Manager  
- **Chrome:** Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` via the browser menu.  
- **Firefox:** Accessed `about:addons` from the menu.

### 2. Reviewed Installed Extensions  
- Carefully examined all installed extensions.  
- Verified each one was intentionally installed and in active use.

### 3. Analyzed Permissions and Extension Details  
- Checked each extensionâ€™s requested permissions (e.g., access to website data, clipboard, browsing history).  
- Evaluated extensions by:
  - Permissions requested  
  - Developer/source authenticity  
  - User reviews and ratings  
  - Last updated date  

### 4. Checked for Suspicious Indicators  
- Looked for signs such as:
  - Unknown or unused extensions  
  - Unnecessary permissions  
  - Poor reviews or vague developer info  
  - Browser slowdowns, popups, or redirections  
- **Result:** No suspicious or malicious extensions were found.

### 5. Restarted the Browser  
- Restarted the browser to apply any changes.  
- Observed stable performance and normal behavior.

### 6. Documentation  
- Created a detailed report:  
  **`Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions.pdf`**  
  The report includes:
  - A complete guide on how to analyze extension behavior  
  - Examples of harmful permissions  
  - How to safely remove unwanted extensions  

- Added a screenshot of the current active extensions for reference.  
  *(Both files are already included in the main branch.)*

## Final Outcome  
- No harmful or unnecessary extensions were found.  
- The browser remains clean and secure.  
- Gained hands-on experience in:
  - Analyzing browser extensions  
  - Identifying potential risks  
  - Understanding the impact of permissions and user trust
